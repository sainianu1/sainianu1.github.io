## Project Workings
- Calculated the losses in signal strength due to the transmitter, receiver, and medium and designed the optimal antenna arrangement

- A lightweight isotropic antenna on the drone to allow for maximal transmission of data in all directions regardless of drone location/ orientation in reference to the ground

- A directional antenna with high gain placed on the ground module

- Designing a Antenna PCB to integrate all of the motors and sensors on the physical device.

## Challenges Faced
- Maximizing gain at large distances
- Obtaining high data transmission speeds
